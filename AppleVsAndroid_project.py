# ### Before starting, some clarifications:

# #### 1) Characters that are specific to English texts are encoded using the ASCII standard. Each ASCII character has a corresponding number between 0 and 127.
# 
# #### 2) We use ord(). Is a built-in function to find out the corresponding encoding number of -each- character, this is letter, number, etc..

# In[17]:


# Examples:

character = 'y'

# find unicode of P
unicode_char = ord(character)
print(unicode_char)
# Output: 121

character = '5'

# find unicode of P
unicode_char = ord(character)

# # Development & Strategy

# ### My end goal is to find out what kind of apps attracts more people, the more people use our app the better for our revenues:
# 
# ## Strategy: 
# ### 1) Build a simple version of the app in Android.
# ### 2) If enough people are interested in the app, I will develop it further.
# ### 3) If the app is profitable, I will develop it in IOS system.
# 
# ### Therefore, I need to find an app that is succesfull in both markets
# ### 

# ## I will build a frequency table that shows: prime_genre, Genres, Category of the Google Play data set.

# ### I need two functions to analyze the frequency tables:
# #### a) A function to generate frequency tables that shows %
# #### b) A function to display the % in a descending order

# In[22]:


# I will build a frequency table for the prime_genre column of the App Store dataset.
# FristlyI will count the amount of apps for a certain genre. To do that will create
# a dictrionary named table.
def freq_table(dataset, index):
    Table = {}
    Total = 0
    
    for row in dataset:
        Total += 1
        Value = row[index]        #Sum up the number of rows.
        if Value in Table:        #I want to count the number of time that a genre(or a value) appears
            Table[Value] += 1     #If the genre is in the table, I sum up 1 unit. 
        else:
            Table[Value] = 1      #If not, I create the dictionary index and add 1 as a dictionary value.
    
    table_percentages = {}                              #I will calculate the percentages and return them.
    for key in Table:                                   #key means dictionary key which is the same than index.
        Percentage = (Table[key] / Total) * 100         #By typing -table[key]- we are calling to the dictionary value.
        table_percentages[key] = Percentage             #I asign -percentage- the dictionary value of -table_precentages- 
    
    return table_percentages


def display_table(dataset, index):
    Table = freq_table(dataset, index)                # I need to use the data extracted with the function freq_table, to do that I need to asign the results
    TableDisplay = []                                 # of -freq_table- to a variable, I will call the variable -Table-.
    for key in Table:                                 # I create a loop to iterate every index in the dictionary -table-. 
        KeyValueAsTuple = (Table[key], key)            # I want to create a tuple because it is easier to order the values.
        TableDisplay.append(KeyValueAsTuple)          # For every iteration, I change the order of the dictionary and store them as a tuple. 
                                                      # I place first the dictionary value, then the dictionary index.
        
    TableSorted = sorted(TableDisplay, reverse = True)    #I want to print the data. To do that I need to asign the organized data to a variable, called -TableSorted- 
    for entry in TableSorted:                             #
        print(entry[1], ':', entry[0])                    # Remember that I transformed the dictionary in a tuple, so that is why I 
                                                          # Example of frequency table as a tuple [(50,'Genre1'),(89,'Genre2'),(439,'Genre3')]
            
            


# ## I will print Prime_genre from Apple Store data set.

# In[29]:



display_table(AppleFreeApps,-5)


# ## Analyzing results for pime_genre in apple data set
# 
# ### Conclusions:
# #### 1) Games is by far the most common genre
# #### 2) There are 23 genres, 18 genres represent, individuallly, less than 3% over the total. In other words 78% of genres represent less than 3% of the total
# #### 3) The genre with less representation is "Medical"
# #### 4) Does existing apps in the genres with least representations satisfy the current demand? Does they have a high user rating?

# ## I will print Genres and category from Google Play data set.

# In[27]:


display_table(AndroidFreeApps, 1) #Category


# In[28]:


display_table(AndroidFreeApps, -4) #Genres


# ### Note: The previous data is related to the number of apps in each 'genre' / 'category'

# ## It would be interesting to know how many users have each genre.
# ## We can find this in Android data set as 'installs' column. But this information is not available on Apple data set, however we can count the number of 'user rating'

# ## Let's start with Apple data set. I will calculate the average number of user rating per app genre.

# In[6]:


GenresApple = freq_table(AppleFreeApps, -5)

for genre in GenresApple:
    Total = 0                    # I will store the number of ratings for each genre.
    LenGenre = 0                 # I will store the number of apps for each genre.
    for app in AppleFreeApps:    #
        GenreApp = app[-5]
        if GenreApp == genre:
